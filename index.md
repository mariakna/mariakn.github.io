subtitle: Cognitive neuroscientist studying language & memory

My research revolves around the study of language and memory systems. I am interested in how we learn and forget, how these processes are shaped by the context in which we encounter new information, our existing knowledge, and the characteristics of the material we're trying to learn. I am also curious about how these mechanisms evolve as we age.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Rastle lab](https://www.rastlelab.com/home) at Royal Holloway, University of London, England. My current line of research explores how children acquire morphological regularities through exposure to text and how this knowledge contributes to their reading proficiency. This project is a collaboration with [Kathy Rastle](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/kathy-rastle(b536d15d-f070-4b97-bf6e-004ed7e86c55).html), [Marc Brysbaert](http://crr.ugent.be/members/marc-brysbaert), and [Marco Marelli](https://www.marcomarelli.net).

I did my PhD at Macquarie University and University of Potsdam through the [IDEALAB](https://phd-idealab.com/) PhD programme. This work examined neural and behavioural underpinnings of encoding and consolidation in learning of novel words in one's first and later acquired languages. I was supervised by [Audrey BÃ¼rki](https://audreyburki.github.io/Website/), [Lyndsey Nickels](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/lyndsey-nickels), and [Paul Sowman](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/paul-sowman). 

I care deeply about **open science** and healthy research culture. At Royal Holloway, I am the organiser of the [ReproducibiliTea journal club](https://reproducibilitea.org/journal-clubs/#RHUL), where we alternate between paper discussions and more hands-on "how-to" sessions on various aspects of research life. Please fill out [this short form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWUrF8_Catl-w7q70Puxkp69o-GnmSP3K1nRTjXMpISFkzBg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) if you'd like to be added to our mailing list.

I am also passionate about **making research accessible to the wider community** and strive to engage diverse voices in research to drive meaningful societal change. I am always keen to collaborate with learning and education stakeholders, so please get in touch if you are interested in a collaboraion!
  
Outside of work, you can find me kayaking, hiking, playing guitar, or in the gym. I am also a keen reader, and I really like to knit and make pottery.
