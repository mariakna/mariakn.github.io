I am a PhD student in Cognitive Neuroscience, based at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and at the University of Potsdam in Germany. I study how adults learn, retain, consolidate and/or forget words in their first and later-acquired languages. For instance, I am interested in how different aspects of the word learning process are affected by the context in which novel words are trained. My research interests also concern the interplay between different memory systems at different stages of word acquisition, and how this is influenced by familiarity/novelty of new information compared to already existing knowledge. I also have a keen interest in the role of sleep and age-related processes in word learning. I use behavioral and electrophysiological methods to examine these issues. I am an advocate of open science and always eager to learn and implement the most recent methodological and statistical tools in my research.

My amazing supervisors are [Audrey BÃ¼rki](https://audreyburki.github.io/Website/) from UP, and [Lyndsey Nickels](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/lyndsey-nickels) and [Paul Sowman](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/paul-sowman) from MQ.
