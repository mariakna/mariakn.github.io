subtitle: Cognitive neuroscientist interested in language & memory
---

I am a cognitive neuroscientist studying language and memory, with a particular interest, and advanced technical skills, in data analysis and statistics. I am interested in how we learn and forget, and in how these processes are influenced by the context in which new information is encountered, our prior knowledge, and the properties of the information we are trying to learn. I am also curious about how these processes change as we age.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Rastle lab](https://www.rastlelab.com/home) at Royal Holloway, University of London, England. My current line of research explores how children acquire morphological regularities through exposure to text and how this knowledge contributes to their reading proficiency. This project is a collaboration with [Kathy Rastle](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/kathy-rastle(b536d15d-f070-4b97-bf6e-004ed7e86c55).html), [Marc Brysbaert](http://crr.ugent.be/members/marc-brysbaert), and [Marco Marelli](https://www.marcomarelli.net).

I did my PhD at Macquarie University and University of Potsdam through the [IDEALAB](https://phd-idealab.com/) PhD programme. This work examined neural and behavioural underpinnings of encoding and consolidation in learning of novel words in one's first and later acquired languages. I was supervised by [Audrey BÃ¼rki](https://audreyburki.github.io/Website/), [Lyndsey Nickels](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/lyndsey-nickels), and [Paul Sowman](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/paul-sowman). 

I care deeply about open science and healthy research culture. At Royal Holloway, I am the organiser of the [ReproducibiliTea journal club](https://reproducibilitea.org/journal-clubs/#RHUL), where we alternate between paper discussions and more hands-on "how-to" sessions on various aspects of research life. Please fill out [this short form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWUrF8_Catl-w7q70Puxkp69o-GnmSP3K1nRTjXMpISFkzBg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) if you'd like to be added to our mailing list.
  
Outside of work, you can find me kayaking, hiking, playing guitar, or in the gym. I am also a keen reader, and I really like to knit and make pottery.
