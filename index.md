I am a postdoc in the [Rastle lab](https://www.rastlelab.com/home) at Royal Holloway, University of London. The project I am currently working on examines how children and adolescents acquire meaningful morphological information through reading. This project is a collaboration with [Kathy Rastle](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/kathy-rastle(b536d15d-f070-4b97-bf6e-004ed7e86c55).html), [Marc Brysbaert](http://crr.ugent.be/members/marc-brysbaert), and [Marco Marelli](https://www.marcomarelli.net).

I did my PhD at Macquarie University and University of Potsdam through the [IDEALAB](https://phd-idealab.com/) PhD programme. This work examined neural and behavioural underpinnings of encoding and consolidation in learning of novel words in one's first and later acquired languages and was jointly supervised by [Audrey BÃ¼rki](https://audreyburki.github.io/Website/), [Lyndsey Nickels](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/lyndsey-nickels), and [Paul Sowman](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/paul-sowman). 

I am interested in how we learn, retain, consolidate, and forget new information, and how different memory systems interact as we do it. In particular, I am curious about how different aspects of learning are influenced by the context in which new information is encountered as well as by its novelty compared to what we already know. I also have a keen interest in the role of sleep and age-related processes in learning. I am an advocate of open science and am always eager to learn and implement the most recent methodological and statistical tools in my research. 

I am the organiser of the [ReproducibiliTea journal club](https://reproducibilitea.org/journal-clubs/#RHUL) at Royal Holloway. Please fill out [this short form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWUrF8_Catl-w7q70Puxkp69o-GnmSP3K1nRTjXMpISFkzBg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0) if you'd like to be added to our mailing list.
  
Outside of work, you can find me kayaking, hiking, playing guitar, or in the gym. I am also a keen reader, and I really like to knit and make pottery.
