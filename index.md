subtitle: Researching learning of and through language
---

I am a researcher interested in how we acquire knowledge of language and use language to facilitate learning and knowledge acquisition in other domains and across the lifespan. I study these questions using tools from cognitive science and neuroscience.

Presently, I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Rastle lab](https://www.rastlelab.com/home) at Royal Holloway, University of London. My current line of research explores what children learn through exposure to text and how this knowledge contributes to their reading fluency and proficiency. This project is a collaboration with [Kathy Rastle](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/kathy-rastle(b536d15d-f070-4b97-bf6e-004ed7e86c55).html), [Marc Brysbaert](http://crr.ugent.be/members/marc-brysbaert), and [Marco Marelli](https://www.marcomarelli.net). I did my PhD at Macquarie University and University of Potsdam through the [IDEALAB](https://phd-idealab.com/) PhD programme. This work examined neural and behavioural underpinnings of encoding and consolidation in learning of novel words in one's first and later acquired languages. I was supervised by [Audrey BÃ¼rki](https://audreyburki.github.io/Website/), [Lyndsey Nickels](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/lyndsey-nickels), and [Paul Sowman](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/paul-sowman). 

I have a strong interest in **applied statistics** and care deeply about **open science** and healthy research culture. I am also passionate about **making research accessible** and **involving diverse voices into research** to drive positive change. If you're an educator, parent, or policymaker interested in collaborating, I'd love to hear from you!
  
Outside of work, you can find me kayaking, hiking, playing guitar, or in the gym. I am also a keen reader, and I really like to knit and make pottery.
