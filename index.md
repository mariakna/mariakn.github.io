I am a PhD student in Cognitive Science, based at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, and at the University of Potsdam in Germany. I study how adults learn, retain, consolidate and/or forget words in their first and later-acquired languages. For instance, I am interested in how different aspects of the word learning process are affected by the context in which novel words are trained. My research interests also concern the interplay between the episodic and semantic memory systems at different stages of word meaning acquisition, and how this is influenced by familiarity/novelty of new information compared to pre-existing knowledge. I also have a keen interest in the role of sleep and age-related processes in word learning. I use behavioral and electrophysiological methods to examine this. I am also very enthusiastic about statistics.

My amazing supervisors are [Lyndsey Nickels](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/lyndsey-nickels) from MQ and [Audrey BÃ¼rki](https://audreyburki.github.io/Website/) from UP.

### And finally...

Apart from my love to cognitive and neuroscience, I am an avid reader with a background in literary criticism and an art aficionado. I am also very passionate about [contemporary dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_dance) and try to get better at it with every opportunity. Another thing I absolutely love doing is literary translation. Unfortunately, I am unable to pursue this career now but, having translated in the past (e.g. [this book](http://albuscorvus.ru/product/lenses/)), I do hope I will manage to do more in the future. There are tons of other activities I enjoy, ranging from knitting to playing guitar and hiking. 

I am **very** concerned about the human impact on the environment (including but not limited to climate change). I'd like to use this opportunity to encourage you to abstain from the use of animal products (in any form) and consume with awareness! Thank you!
