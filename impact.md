### CYP-LEX - A large-scale lexical database of books read by British children aged 7-16

The CYP-LEX project is a collaboration with [Kathy Rastle](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/en/persons/kathy-rastle), [Marc Brysbaert](https://research.ugent.be/web/person/marc-brysbaert-0/en), and [Marco Marelli](https://www.marcomarelli.net/). The aim of this work was to create a lexical database of words that British children aged 7-16 encounter when they read for pleasure. To this end, we built a corpus of 1,200 books popular with children and young people in the UK, and analysed the properties of words used in these books.
The associated [research article](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17470218241229694) came out in March 2024, and is publicly available and free to download.
Kathy and I also wrote an accessible [blog post](https://www.rastlelab.com/post/what-words-do-children-encounter-when-they-read-for-pleasure) explaining the key insights from our analysis.

Within a month of its publication, our paper has attracted a lot of attention from teachers, teacher educators, and literacy charities (see below). It has been highlighted that the "implications [of this research] can be profound for the choices we make to help pupils learn language".
