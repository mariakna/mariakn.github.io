Read our new paper on behavioural and electrophysiological markers of integration of novel words into semantic memory - published in LCN open access!

**Korochkina, M.**, Nickels, L., & BÃ¼rki, A. (2024). What can we learn about integration of novel words into semantic memory from automatic semantic priming? *Language, Cognition, and Neuroscience*. [https://doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2024.2328586](https://doi.org/10.1080/23273798.2024.2328586)
