Our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/17470218241229694) introducing CYP-LEX, a large-scale lexical database of books popular with children and young people in the UK, is finally out! It's open access and free to download.
Kathy and I also wrote a short and accessible [blog post](https://www.rastlelab.com/post/what-words-do-children-encounter-when-they-read-for-pleasure) summarsing the main insights from this work.
We are now using this corpus to better understand what children can learn about morphology through reading. This work involves some cool computational modelling, and we expect to share the first results in a few months. Stay tuned!
