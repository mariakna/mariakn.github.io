I will be presenting my most recent work on novel word integration into semantic memory in a slide slam session at the virtual **SNL** meeting this year (5-8 Oct, 2021).
The full schedule can be found [here](https://2021.neurolang.org/) or [here](https://www.neurolang.org/). I've been scheduled to present in **Slide Slam Session E on October 5th (Tue) from 5.30pm to 7.30pm PDT** (11.30am-1.30pm DST on October 6th, Wed, in Sydney). My [5-minute talk as well as the supporting documentation](https://2021.neurolang.org/?p=E4) can be viewed on the conference website anytime, and I will upload the slides (including references) to my homepage (to be located under [Research output](https://mariakna.github.io/research/)) immediately after the conference.

Looking forward!
