I will be presenting the most recent findings from the children and young people's books lexicon that we've been developing over the past year at the [EPS meeting in Swansea (12-14 July)](https://eps.ac.uk/next-meeting/) and at [ESCoP in Porto (6-9 Sept)](https://escop2023.org/). In addition, Kathy Rastle will be sharing our insights into what kids and young people in the UK are reading at the [Research and Practice meeting at Royal Holloway on 7 July](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/psychology/research/serns/serns-events/2023-1/).
Very much looking forward to sharing this work with you!
