Very excited to announce that I got a sponsored (by Macquarie Uni) seat to attend the [Software Carpentries Instructor Training](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/) which will be taking place this March!

And another piece of news: I got to run my very first [webinar on how to fit GLMM models in R (in the frequentist framework)](https://github.com/mariakna/MQ-eResearchTraining-GLMMs) this week! 
The webinar was part of a series of talks and workshops in this year's first [eResearch Training](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/2021-eresearch-training-kickoff-at-macquarie-university-tickets-136557911389) at MQ.
I'm really happy that I was given such a great opportunity to learn more myself and share my knowledge with others.
