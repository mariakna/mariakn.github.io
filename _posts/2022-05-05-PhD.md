I submitted my PhD today! Very keen to see what the examiners will say - have a very impressive team and am honoured that they have agreed :)
My thesis has been prepared in the thesis-by-publication format, with all experimental chapters written as independent and stand-alone publications - one was published in JML last year, and the other two are currently under review.
