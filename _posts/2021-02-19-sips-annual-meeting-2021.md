This year, I will be attending (for the first time) the 6th annual meeting of [The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS)](http://improvingpsych.org/). 
It is a relatively new conference that aims to improve methods and practices in psychological science, and it definitely seems worth attending! 
The meeting will take place virtually (via Zoom) on 23-25 of June. The registration is already open (see [here](https://www.improvingpsych.org/SIPS2021/)), and the conference fee is very affordable, even for students!

Looking forward to the interesting talks and discussions!
