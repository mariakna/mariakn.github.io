Excited to announce that I will be organising the ReproducbiliTea journal club at RHUL this year!<br>
In addition to paper discussions, there will be how-to talks and tutorials on different research methods, and everyone's welcome to attend (in person or via Teams).<br>
The first meeting will take place on the 7th of November.<br>
Our schedule and all the relevant materials can be found [here](https://osf.io/m4hn7/).<br>
If you'd like to be added to our mailing list, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWUrF8_Catl-w7q70Puxkp69o-GnmSP3K1nRTjXMpISFkzBg/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0).
