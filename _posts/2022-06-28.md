I will be presenting the most recent study from my PhD project at the [AMLaP conference](https://amlap2022.york.ac.uk) this year which will take place between the 7th and the 9th of September at the University of York.
This will be a poster presentation entitled "Neural correlates of encoding in learning of novel names for novel concepts". Date and time of the poster session TBA!
