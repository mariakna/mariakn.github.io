Got the Potsgraduate Research Fund this week! Just hope I'd be able to actually use the money. 
My trip (conference in the US and lab visits in the UK) was planned for November but who knows whether the situation gets better by then...

Happy that my application was successful given how competitive PGRF is but must admit that trivial things like that don't matter at all compared to so many foreseeable (and unforeseeable) consequences of the pandemic for other people.
