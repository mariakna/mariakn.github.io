[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) just notified me that my checkout process is completed and I may now call myself a Badged Instructor! 
I have learned so much in my instructor training in March and while preparing for the teaching demo. Really looking forward to teaching my first R workshop - stay tuned :)
